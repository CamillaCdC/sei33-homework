    <h2>Younger Age</h2>
    <p>
      Phiber Optik aka Mark Albene was a hacker during the early 80s and 90s. As a young man he grow up with the earliest of generations of commercial computers. Before he got his hacker name he would search the internet for more information on how to improve and understand his computer knowledge. He'd do this by tracking down other people with the same computer as him and trading information.

       Not long after he found himself digging through universities archives learning and teaching himself some of the skills which he'd use in his later life. The operaters of these universitie mainframes were always well awear and would actually make friendships with these hackers like Mark. This was a very different time as there was no rules or regulations about security of information, it was a time where the internet was a sea of information ripe for the taking.

      In 1993 Mark was sentence to prison. He was Accused for crashing the AT&T network at first. This was a Americas largest phone network system at the time, hosting over 70% of their calls. What was later found out that the system software crashed from a update which had been recently installed. The area of law to do with internet security was a grey area, however he was set as an example to the world by charging him with tampering and computer trespassing to the first degree.

      Mark was a very vocal person as he had been very well known through his friend radio station and his deep roots within the hacking community. This was seen as a outrage, what the government was saying by their actions was to controll information access to the public which had always been there freely before. The plot thickened as speeches and protest about corporations who held a strong controll over the average consumer was openly discussed. His actions pushed critical thinking into the minds of those who would listen and paved a small but shinny light for those who fight for right to have what they deserve.
