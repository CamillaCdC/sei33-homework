      <h1>Margaret Hamilton, Lead Software Engineer for NASA’s Apollo 11 Mission</h1>
      <h2>“There was no choice but to be pioneers.”</h2>

      <p>That’s what Margaret Hamilton has to say about her experience engineering software for NASA at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in the 1960s. Back then, software engineering was a relatively obscure profession and regarded by many “as an art and as magic, not a science.” Margaret Hamilton is credited with coining the term “software engineering”–the implementation of programming methodologies used to make a project happen–during her work at MIT and, along with her team, wrote the code for Apollo 11’s on-board flight software.</p>

      <p>In the early 1960s Hamilton learned about MIT’s NASA contract to develop the software for sending man to the moon. She knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime, so she applied and got a job working on the software engineering team.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Hamilton’s recommendations for creating software that could respond to human error were eventually taken seriously. In 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission—the mission to land Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon—Hamilton’s vision of effective software proved its worth.</p>
