      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      <p>"Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose"</p>
      <p>"I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design"</p>
      <p>"People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do"</p>
      <p>"You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your life is better"</p>
