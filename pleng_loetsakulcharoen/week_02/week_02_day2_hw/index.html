                <h3>Get to know Ada</h3>
                <p>Ada was the daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace—better known as "Ada Lovelace"—was born in London on December 10, 1815. Ada showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Ada is considered the first computer programmer. Ada died on November 27, 1852. <br><a href = '/Users/plengloetsakulcharoen/Project/sei33-homework/pleng_loetsakulcharoen/week_02_day2_hw/index2.html'>Read more</a></p>

        <h3>Ada's notes</h3>
        <p>Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed so her program was never tested. <br><a href = '/Users/plengloetsakulcharoen/Project/sei33-homework/pleng_loetsakulcharoen/week_02_day2_hw/index2.html'>Read more</a></p>
