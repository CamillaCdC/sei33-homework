  <li><span class="bold">1986</span>  The son of anti-war activists, Julian Assange showed an early aptitude for hacking. At 16, he began hacking under the name Mendax with two friends in Melbourne, calling themselves the “International Subversives.” Together they successfully hacked into a number of high-profile targets, including the Pentagon, Citibank, Lockheed Martin, and several universities.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span class="bold">1991</span>  Australian Federal Police raided Assange’s home, eventually charging him with 31 counts of hacking and related crimes. He pleaded guilty to 25 and was released with a fine because of his age and lack of malicious intent. Two years later, Assange would cooperate with local law enforcement, providing technical assistance and helping prosecute child pornographers. </li>
  <br>
  <li><span class="bold">2006</span>  Assange and others started WikiLeaks releasing a document that implicated a Somali political figure in an attempt to assassinate government officials, and soliciting similar leaks with a secure online drop box to protect whistleblowers. Anticipating pushback from powerful organizations, Assange assumed a nomadic existence, traveling all over Asia, Africa, and Europe to make WikiLeaks more difficult to track down and attack.</li>
<br>
  <li>
    <span class="bold">2010</span> <em>Time</em>  magazine readers voted him Person of the Year. In his home country of Australia, Assange was awarded the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace with Justice.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><span class="bold">2016</span>  Assange and WikiLeaks returned to the headlines as the U.S. presidential race was narrowing to two main candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. In early July, WikiLeaks released more than 1,200 emails from Clinton's private server during her tenure as secretary of state. Later in the month, WikiLeaks released an additional round of emails from the Democratic National Committee that indicated an effort to undermine Clinton's primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, leading to the resignation of DNC chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</li>
