                    Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (née Monni)—a six-time Finnish national karate champion—whom he first met in late 1993. 
                    Linus was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, 
                    to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date. Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, Patricia Miranda (born 1996), 
                    Daniela Yolanda (born 1998), and Celeste Amanda (born 2000), two of whom were born in the United States. The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts 
                    their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.

                    Torvalds has described himself as "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals 
                    and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' 
                    and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this 
                    could have happened in the first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in the United States 
                    it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that 
                    in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion." However, in a story about 
                    the March LinuxWorld Conference titled "Linus the Liberator", Torvalds is quoted as saying "There are like two golden rules in life. 
                    One is 'Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.' For some reason, people associate this with Christianity. I'm not a Christian. 
                    I'm agnostic. The other rule is 'Be proud of what you do.'"

                    In 2010, Torvalds became a United States citizen and registered to vote in the United States. He is unaffiliated with any U.S. political party, 
                    saying, "I have way too much personal pride to want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly."

                    Linus developed an interest in scuba diving in the early 2000s and went on to achieve numerous certifications, which later led to him creating 
                    the Subsurface project.
