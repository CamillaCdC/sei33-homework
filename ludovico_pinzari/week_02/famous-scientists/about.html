                                <h1>Everyone got a Story ! <br> This is mine:</h1>
                                <p><h4>Donald Ervin “Don” Knuth was born January 10, 1938, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</h4></p>
                                <p><h4>In 1956, Knuth received a scholarship to the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio. While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, one of the early mainframes. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.<br>While working on his PhD in mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, Knuth also did private consulting, and wrote compilers for various computers. The word got around that he knew a lot about compilers, and in January 1962, in his second year at Cal Tech, Addison-Wesley asked him to write a book on compilers. He sketched 12 chapters and signed a contract.</h4></p>

                                <p><h4>Knuth is well-known for his perfectionism, and offers to pay $2.56 for each error found in TAOCP (The Art Of Computer Programming) books. However, He was deeply disappointed when saw the typesetting from Addison-Wesley for the second edition of volume 2, because in 1973 Addison-Wesley had replaced its mechanical typesetting technology with computerized typesetting that did not reproduce the high quality of the original printings of volumes 1-3. Consequently, in 1977 Knuth began developing a new typesetting system (<strong><em>TEX</em></strong> ) to enable high quality computerized typesetting, in particular for TAOCP. <br>Consequently, in 1977 Knuth began developing a new typesetting system to enable high quality computerized typesetting, in particular for AOCP. Today, <strong><em>LATEX</em></strong> is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. </h4></p>
