withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction. - okay

should be red. It should be gray when there is money in the account. - okay    
* What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking

a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking
balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account. - okay 
If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it. - okay
* Make sure there is overdraft protection going both ways. -okay
* Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer? -okay
