                <p>Sophie Mary Wilson (born 1957) is a leading computer scientist who has been named
                    one of The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History. Wilson designed the Acorn Micro-Computer, the
                    first of a long line of computers sold by Acorn Computers Ltd, including its programming language
                    BBC BASIC. Wilson later designed the instruction set of the ARM processor, which is used in most
                    21st-century smartphones. Wilson serves as a director at the technology conglomerate Broadcom Inc.
                    In 2016, Wilson was appointed an honorary fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.</p>

                <p>Wilson was raised in Leeds, Yorkshire, by parents who were both teachers, her father specialising in
                    English and her mother in physics. She studied computer science and the Mathematical Tripos at
                    the University of Cambridge. In an Easter break from university, Wilson designed a microcomputer
                    with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor inspired by the earlier MK14, which was used to
                    electronically control feed for cows.</p>

                <p>In 1978, she joined Acorn Computers Ltd, after designing a device to prevent cigarette lighter sparks
                    triggering payouts on fruit machines. Her computer design was used by Chris Curry and Hermann
                    Hauser to build the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by the company.
                </p>
                <p>In July 1981, Wilson extended the Acorn Atom's BASIC programming language dialect into an improved
                    version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the
                    British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project. Hauser
                    played a mental game where he told both Wilson and colleague Steve Furber that the other had agreed
                    a prototype could be built within a week. Agreeing to the challenge, she designed the system
                    including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM
                    integrated circuits to be sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been
                    built, but the software had bugs, requiring her to stay up all night and into Friday debugging.
                    Wilson recalled watching the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer on a small portable
                    television while attempting to debug and re-solder the prototype. </p>
                <p>It was a success with the BBC, who
                    awarded Acorn the contract. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first
                    airing on television, in case any software fixes were required. She later described the event as "a
                    unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and
                    taught how to program." The Proton became the BBC Micro and its BASIC evolved into BBC BASIC,
                    whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years. As well as programming, she wrote the
                    manuals and technical specifications, realising communication was an important part of being
                    successful.</p>
                <p>In October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the first reduced instruction
                    set computer (RISC) processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM), The ARM1 was delivered on 26 April
                    1985 and worked first time. This processor type was later to become one of the most successful
                    IP cores — a licensed CPU core — and by 2012 was being used in 95% of smartphones.</p>

                <p>She was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos Interactive, which bought
                    and created Eidos Interactive, for the years following its flotation in 1990, and was a
                    consultant to ARM Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.

                        Since the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to
                        talk about work done there. She is now the Director of IC Design in Broadcom's Cambridge, UK
                        office. She was the Chief
                        Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor. Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers,
                        which, after being renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000.</p>
                    <p>She was listed in 2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled The 15 Most Important
                        Women in Tech History. She was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in
                        California in 2012 "for her work, with Steve Furber, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM
                        processor architecture." In 2013 Wilson was elected as a Fellow of the
                        prestigious Royal Society. She received the 2014 Lovie Lifetime Achievement Award in
                        acknowledgement for her significant invention of the ARM processor.</p>

                    <p>Wilson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday
                        Honours for services to computing.

                    group, where she is in charge of costumes and set pieces and has acted in a number of productions.
                    She has also played a cameo role as a pub landlady in the BBC
                    television drama Micro Men, in which a younger Wilson is played by Stefan Butler.</p>
