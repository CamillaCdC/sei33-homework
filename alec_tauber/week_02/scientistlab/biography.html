        Zawinski's early career included stints with Scott Fahlman's Lisp research group at Carnegie Mellon University, Expert Technologies, Inc. and Robert Wilensky and Peter Norvig's group at Berkeley. In the early 1990s, he was hired by Richard P. Gabriel's Lucid Inc. where he was eventually put to work on Lucid's Energize C++ IDE. Lucid decided to use GNU Emacs as the text editor for their IDE due to its free license, popularity, and extensibility. Zawinski and the other programmers made fundamental changes to GNU Emacs to add new functionality. Tensions over how to merge these patches into the main tree eventually led to the fork of the project into GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

        Zawinski, with Marc Andreessen's help, worked on the early releases of Netscape Navigator, particularly the 1.0 release of the Unix version.[3][4] He became quite well known in the early days of the World Wide Web through an easter egg in the Netscape browser: typing "about:jwz" into the address box would take the user to his home page (a similar trick worked for other Netscape staffers). In addition, Zawinski says he came up with the name "Mozilla" in a staff meeting.[5][6]

        In 2000, Zawinski starred in the 60-minute-long PBS documentary "Code Rush". The footage was taken during 1998 while Zawinski was still working for Netscape in which he is portrayed as a pivotal person in the company. In addition, he underlined his preference for the night scene which led him to buy a nightclub.[7]

        Zawinski was a major proponent of opening the source code of the Mozilla browser and a key person in the creation of the Mozilla project, but became disillusioned with the project when others decided to rewrite the code instead of incrementally improving it.[8][9] When Netscape was acquired by AOL he wrote a bulletin explaining the nature of the Free Software Mozilla code.[10] He resigned from Netscape Communications Corporation on April 1, 1999.[11] [12] His current occupation is managing his DNA Lounge nightclub in San Francisco.

          <li>They need to take general relativity into account even for the orbit of Jupiter, which precesses about one radian per billion years.

They take the asteroid belt into account only as modification of the sun's quadrupole moment (which they also use to model its oblateness).

The most worrisome thing about the whole simulation - the most complicated and unpredictable aspect of the whole solar system in terms of its gravitational effects on everything else - is the Earth-Moon system, with its big tidal effects.

The sun loses one Earth mass per 100 million years due to radiation, and another quarter Earth mass due to solar wind.

The first planet to go is Mercury! In their simulations, it eventually picks up energy through a resonance and drifts away.</li>
