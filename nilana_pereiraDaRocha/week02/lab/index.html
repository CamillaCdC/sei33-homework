                <p>Sophie Mary Wilson (born 1957) is a leading computer scientist who has been named
                    one of The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History. Wilson designed the Acorn Micro-Computer, the
                    first of a long line of computers sold by Acorn Computers Ltd, including its programming language
                    BBC BASIC. Wilson later designed the instruction set of the ARM processor, which is used in most
                    21st-century smartphones. Wilson serves as a director at the technology conglomerate Broadcom Inc.
                    In 2016, Wilson was appointed an honorary fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.</p>

                <p>Wilson was raised in Leeds, Yorkshire, by parents who were both teachers, her father specialising in
                    English and her mother in physics. She studied computer science and the Mathematical Tripos at
                    the University of Cambridge. In an Easter break from university, Wilson designed a microcomputer
                    with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor inspired by the earlier MK14, which was used to
                    electronically control feed for cows.</p>
