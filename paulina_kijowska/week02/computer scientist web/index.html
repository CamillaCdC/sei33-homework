<p> When he was a teenager Julian was a hacker under the name Mendax. As the founder and public face of WikiLeaks, a website that posts secret documents and information in the public domain, Julian Assange believes that total transparency is for the good of all people. But Assange — who reportedly lives an itinerant existence, traveling the world with a backpack and computer — is himself a shadowy figure. Little is known about his life: he has refused to confirm his age in interviews or give a fixed address. </p>
